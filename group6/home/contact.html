                    <td>I struggled with the navigation bar because I didn’t know how the dropdown mechanism worked. I searched for many versions of code and they used div elements rather than the nav element but I thought I could somehow integrate those two together but it didn’t work because the dropdown content was scattered beside the sections rather than hidden so I discarded that thought and just worked with the div elements.<br>
                    I was overcomplicating the containers for the images’ description located at the end of the individual bird pages like the flamingo page. I originally used the code from W3 for side-by-side images but then the footer content was acting up and I couldn’t style it properly. I discarded that and later found that using width property was simpler to use.</td>

                    <td>A mistake I made was using lists for the animal facts on each home page. While it worked at the start it then caused problems when I decided to change other parts of the website, so I went back and changed it to p tags instead.<br>
                    Another mistake I made was not putting in any css comments so when my group members went to look at my code they didn’t know where each piece was.</td>

                    <td>Nikita</td>
                    <td>I struggled with my header images for my individual homepages. At first the images would always take up a large portion of the screen and I could not make it fit into the header section. I fixed this by making the position relative and make the margin: 0 auto. Then another problem occured where my text would be too small for the header image and would not fit in the right place. I went onto w3schools and found a solution where it would perfectly match up with the width of the image by making the position absolute and changing the width to 99%.<br>
                    I also struggled with the alternating grey and white backgrounds in the image gallery section on the homepage. I couldn't make it so that both the text underneath the images and the images themselves would have the same back, it would always be one or the other. I realised I used to many section tags that might have been causing the problem. I made a section tag for each animal images and text which was a mistake. I got rid of the section tags and just add div tags explaining what part would be grey or white and making the text under the images underneath the that same div instead of making a new seperate one.</td>

                    Another problem I faced was getting the nav bar to have a drop down menu. I didn't properly format the code which led to it overlapping at some points.

                    Another mistake I made was that lion-facts-pic was not styling how I wanted it to. I fixed this by making it a div.</td>
